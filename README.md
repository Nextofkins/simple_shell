HOW IT WORKS

hsh is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
In order to use this shell, in a terminal, first run the program: $ ./hsh
It will then display a simple prompt and wait for commands.
This shell will handle two types of commands: builtins and normal program.
